                The University of Michigan (Michigan or UMich) is a public 
                research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1817 
                by an act of the old Michigan Territory, as the Catholepistemiad, 
                or the University of Michigania, 20 years before the territory 
                became a state, the university is Michigan's oldest. The 
                institution was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40 acres (16 ha) 
                of what is now known as Central Campus, a U.S. historic district. 
                Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university has expanded 
                to include some 500 buildings spread out over the city. The 
                university has been governed by an elected board of regents 
                independently of the state since 1850, when the state's second 
                constitution was officially adopted.
